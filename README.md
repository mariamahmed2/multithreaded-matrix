# Multithreaded Matrix

This project offers various methods for handling matrices. First, read the dimensions of the matrices from a
text file, read the actual matrices from a text file, solve the matrices using a single thread, solve the matrices by
rows (with one thread per row), and solve the matrices by element (with one thread per element). 

Additionally,there are two different methods for creating threads: one for solving the matrices by rows, and another for
solving the matrices by elements
